# unnportal-php
Authenticate and get details about your application's users through their unnportal details.

This is a PHP package that provides an unofficial API for the University of Nigeria student portal located at http://unnportal.unn.edu.ng

# Usage:
Add to your `composer.json`:
```
require": {
        "shalvah/unnportal-api": "^1.0.0"
    }
```

Sample:
```
use \UnnPortal\UnnStudent;

$username = "201x/1xxxxx";
$password = "xxxxxx";

$student = new UnnStudent($username, $password);
$student->login();
```

If the login fails, an instance of `UnnPortal\UnnPortalException` will be thrown.

# Use Cases
1. You're building an application which you want to be available only to UNN students.
```
try{
    $student->login();
} catch (UnnPortalException $e) {
   echo "Please enter correct UNN login details.";
}
```
You could even add email verification to it.

2. You're building an application which you want to be available only to **certain** UNN students eg males in Political Science:
```
if($student->sex() == "Male" && $student->department() == "POLITICAL SCIENCE") {
    //allow them through
}
```
